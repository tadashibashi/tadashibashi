Hello! I'm a developer and conservatory-trained composer. I enjoy building things from the ground up.

Right now, I am working on cross-platform development in graphics and audio. 
To that end, here are some projects I'm currently working on.

Overall, using the the logical and creative aspects from my music training, I find that the discipline of computer science has significant crossover in terms of craftsmanship and technical excellence acquired through long hours of study and practice.

I'd invite any developer to begin studying music, and you might find a unique creative avenue that may resonate with you.
